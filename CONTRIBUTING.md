LighterPack contributing guide
===========
Thanks for your interest in contributing to LighterPack!

LighterPack currently has a bit of technical debt that needs to be paid down before any new feature work can resume. Namely, the original site was written in jQuery and is not very maintainable, so a rewrite using Vue.js is in-progress.

In order to get the project into a state where we can add new features, the only pull requests accepted will be bug fixes and feature parity work for the `vue` branch.

**2019-05-04 update: The most help we need right now is manually testing the Vue rewrite to ensure it is bug-free and feature-complete with the original version of LighterPack.**

If you're interested in contributing and would like to join the slack channel, please [email me](mailto:galenmaly@gmail.com) for an invite. Might take up to 3 days to get back to you.

I'm excited to get the rewrite launched so we can resume active feature development! Once we get to that point these contributing guidelines will be updated.
