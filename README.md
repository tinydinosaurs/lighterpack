LighterPack
===========
LighterPack is a website to track the gear you take on adventures. 

The original version of LighterPack was built on a node.js/jQuery/vanillaJS/mongo stack, and a rewrite using Vue is in-progress.

Development on the original verion in the master branch has ceased, please check out the `vue` branch for active development. If you're interested in contributing to LighterPack, please check out the [contributing page](https://github.com/galenmaly/lighterpack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
